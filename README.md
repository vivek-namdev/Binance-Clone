# Binance Dupe

This is my attempt at creating a Binance clone. Storybook was malfunctioning with module aliases, so I've created a single storybook without using module aliases. Make sure you have npm version `9.5.0`. Here are some things to note.

- Theming -> Light and Dark Mode (top right button)
- Storybook
- Types are written carefully

**Note** The trading view widget takes a few refreshes before turning on.

There are still quite a lot of issues with this and much to be worked on. 

- Total time spent on this particular project (since assigned) - 20 hours
- Total time spent learning React, Typescript, NextJS, Tailwind, MUI, etc. (since assigned) - 100+ hours

I could have been more efficient and done this under 10 hours, but honestly am not at the level to complete something like this under 6 hours. Maybe a few more weeks of practice will allow me to make something like this under 4 hours.

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run storybook
```
