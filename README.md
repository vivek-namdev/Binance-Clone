# Binance Dupe

This is my attempt at creating a Binance clone. Storybook was malfunctioning with module aliases, so I've created a single storybook without using module aliases.

- Theming -> Light and Dark Mode (top right button)
- Storybook
- Types are written carefully

**Note** The trading view widget takes a few refreshes before turning on.


## Running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run storybook
```
